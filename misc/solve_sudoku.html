<h1>Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle</h1>

<h3>by Peter Norvig</h3>

In this essay I tackle the problem of solving every Sudoku puzzle. It
turns out to be quite easy (about <a href="sudopy.shtml">one page</a> of code
for the main idea and two pages for embellishments) using two ideas:
<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction">constraint propagation</a></b> and <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm">search</a></b>.

<h2>Sudoku Notation and Preliminary Notions</h2>

First we have to agree on some notation. A Sudoku puzzle is a
<i>grid</i> of 81 squares; the majority of enthusiasts label the
columns 1-9, the rows A-I, and call a collection of nine squares
(column, row, or box) a <i>unit</i> and the squares that share a unit
the <i>peers</i>.  A puzzle leaves some squares blank and fills others with digits, and
the whole idea is:
<blockquote>
<i>A puzzle is solved if the squares in each unit are filled with a permutation of the digits 1 to 9.</i>
</blockquote>
That is, no digit can appear twice
in a unit, and every digit must appear once. This implies that each square
must have a different value from any of its peers.
Here are the names of the squares, a typical puzzle,
and the solution to the puzzle:

<p>

</pre>

<p>Every square has exactly 3 units and 20 peers. For example,
here are the units and peers for the square <tt>C2</tt>:
<pre  class="prettyprint">
    A2   |         |                    |         |            A1 A2 A3|         |         
    B2   |         |                    |         |            B1 B2 B3|         |         
    <b>C2</b>   |         |            C1 <b>C2</b> C3| C4 C5 C6| C7 C8 C9   C1 <b>C2</b> C3|         |         
---------+---------+---------  ---------+---------+---------  ---------+---------+---------

    E2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |         
    F2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |         
---------+---------+---------  ---------+---------+---------  ---------+---------+---------
    G2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |         
    H2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |         
    I2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |         
</pre>

We can implement the notions of units, peers, and squares in
the programming language <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> (2.5 or later) as
follows:

<p>
<pre  class="prettyprint">
def cross(A, B):
    "Cross product of elements in A and elements in B."
    return [a+b for a in A for b in B]

digits   = '123456789'
rows     = 'ABCDEFGHI'
cols     = digits
squares  = cross(rows, cols)
unitlist = ([cross(rows, c) for c in cols] +
            [cross(r, cols) for r in rows] +
            [cross(rs, cs) for rs in ('ABC','DEF','GHI') for cs in ('123','456','789')])
units = dict((s, [u for u in unitlist if s in u]) 
             for s in squares)
peers = dict((s, set(sum(units[s],[]))-set([s]))
             for s in squares)
</pre>

<p>If you are not familiar with some of the features of Python, note
that a <tt>dict</tt> or dictionary is Python's name for a hash table
that maps each key to a value; that these are specified as a
sequence of (key, value) tuples; that <tt>dict((s, [...]) for s in
squares)</tt> creates a dictionary which maps each square <tt>s</tt>
to a value that is the list <tt>[...]</tt>; and that the expression <tt>[u for u in
unitlist if s in u]</tt> means that this value is the list of units
<tt>u</tt> such that the square <tt>s</tt> is a member of <tt>u</tt>.
So read this assignment statement as "<tt>units</tt> is a dictionary
where each square maps to the list of units that contain the square".
Similarly, read the next assignment statement as "<tt>peers</tt> is a
dictionary where each square <tt>s</tt> maps to the set of squares
formed by the union of the squares in the units of <tt>s</tt>, but not <tt>s</tt> itself".

<p>It can't hurt to throw in some tests (they all pass):
<p>
<pre  class="prettyprint">
def test():
    "A set of unit tests."
    assert len(squares) == 81
    assert len(unitlist) == 27
    assert all(len(units[s]) == 3 for s in squares)
    assert all(len(peers[s]) == 20 for s in squares)
    assert units['C2'] == [['A2', 'B2', 'C2', 'D2', 'E2', 'F2', 'G2', 'H2', 'I2'],
                           ['C1', 'C2', 'C3', 'C4', 'C5', 'C6', 'C7', 'C8', 'C9'],
                           ['A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'B1', 'B2', 'B3', 'C1', 'C2', 'C3']]
    assert peers['C2'] == set(['A2', 'B2', 'D2', 'E2', 'F2', 'G2', 'H2', 'I2',
                               'C1', 'C3', 'C4', 'C5', 'C6', 'C7', 'C8', 'C9',
                               'A1', 'A3', 'B1', 'B3'])
    print 'All tests pass.'
</pre>

<p>Now that we have squares, units, and peers, the next step is to
define the Sudoku playing grid.  Actually we need two representations:
First, a textual format used to specify the initial state of a puzzle;
we will reserve the name <i>grid</i> for this.  Second, an internal
representation of any state of a puzzle, partially solved or complete;
this we will call a <i>values</i> collection because it will give all
the remaining possible values for each square.  

For the textual format (<i>grid</i>) we'll allow a string of
characters with 1-9 indicating a digit, and a 0 or period specifying
an empty square.  All other characters are ignored (including spaces,
newlines, dashes, and bars).  So each of the following three grid strings
represent the same puzzle:

<pre class="prettyprint">
"4.....8.5.3..........7......2.....6.....8.4......1.......6.3.7.5..2.....1.4......"

"""
400000805
030000000
000700000
020000060
000080400
000010000
000603070
500200000
104000000"""

"""
4 . . |. . . |8 . 5 
. 3 . |. . . |. . . 
. . . |7 . . |. . . 
------+------+------

------+------+------
. . . |6 . 3 |. 7 . 
5 . . |2 . . |. . . 
1 . 4 |. . . |. . . 
"""</pre>

<p> Now for <i>values</i>.
One might think that a 9 x 9 array
would be the obvious data structure.  But squares
have names like <tt>'A1'</tt>, not <tt>(0,0)</tt>.
Therefore, <i>values</i> will be a dict with squares as keys. The
value of each key will be the possible digits for that square: a
single digit if it was given as part of the puzzle definition or if we have
figured out what it must be, and a collection of several digits if
we are still uncertain. 
This collection of digits
could be represented by a Python <tt>set</tt> or <tt>list</tt>, but I chose instead
to use a string of digits (we'll see why later).  So a
grid where <tt>A1</tt> is <tt>7</tt>
and <tt>C7</tt> is empty would be represented as <tt>{'A1': '7', 'C7':
'123456789', ...}</tt>. 

<p>Here is the code to parse a grid into a <i>values</i> dict:
<p>
<pre  class="prettyprint">
def parse_grid(grid):
    """Convert grid to a dict of possible values, {square: digits}, or
    return False if a contradiction is detected."""
    ## To start, every square can be any digit; then assign values from the grid.
    values = dict((s, digits) for s in squares)
    for s,d in grid_values(grid).items():
        if d in digits and not assign(values, s, d):
            return False ## (Fail if we can't assign d to square s.)
    return values

def grid_values(grid):
    "Convert grid into a dict of {square: char} with '0' or '.' for empties."
    chars = [c for c in grid if c in digits or c in '0.']
    assert len(chars) == 81
    return dict(zip(squares, chars))
</pre>

<h2>Constraint Propagation</h2>

The function <tt>parse_grid</tt> calls <tt>assign(values, s, d)</tt>.
We could implement this as <tt>values[s] = d</tt>, but we can do more
than just that.  Those with experience solving Sudoku puzzles know
that there are two important strategies that we can use to make progress towards
filling in all the squares:

<blockquote>
<i>(1) If a square has only one possible value, then eliminate that value from the square's peers.
<br>(2) If a unit has only one possible place for a value, then put the value there.</i>
</blockquote>

As an example of strategy (1) if we assign 7 to <tt>A1</tt>, yielding <tt>{'A1':
'7', 'A2':'123456789', ...}</tt>, we see that <tt>A1</tt> has only one
value, and thus the 7 can be removed from its peer <tt>A2</tt> (and all other peers), giving
us <tt>{'A1': '7', 'A2': '12345689', ...}</tt>. As an example of strategy (2),
if it turns out that none of <tt>A3</tt> through <tt>A9</tt> has a 3
as a possible value, then the 3 must belong in <tt>A2</tt>, and we can
update to <tt>{'A1': '7', 'A2':'3', ...}</tt>.
These updates to <tt>A2</tt> may in turn cause further updates to
its peers, and the peers of those peers, and so on. This process is
called <i>constraint propagation</i>.

<p>The function <tt>assign(values, s, d)</tt> will return the updated
<i>values</i> (including the updates from constraint propagation), but
if there is a contradiction--if the assignment cannot be made
consistently--then <tt>assign</tt> returns <tt>False</tt>.  For
example, if a grid starts with the digits <tt>'77...'</tt> then when
we try to assign the 7 to <tt>A2</tt>, <tt>assign</tt> would notice
that 7 is not a possibility for <tt>A2</tt>, because it was eliminated
by the peer, <tt>A1</tt>.

<p>It turns out that the fundamental operation is not assigning a value, but
rather eliminating one of the possible values for a square, which we
implement with <tt>eliminate(values, s, d)</tt>. Once we have
<tt>eliminate</tt>, then <tt>assign(values, s, d)</tt> can be
defined as "eliminate all the values from <tt>s</tt> except <tt>d</tt>".

<p>
<pre  class="prettyprint">
def assign(values, s, d):
    """Eliminate all the other values (except d) from values[s] and propagate.
    Return values, except return False if a contradiction is detected."""
    other_values = values[s].replace(d, '')
    if all(eliminate(values, s, d2) for d2 in other_values):
        return values
    else:
        return False

def eliminate(values, s, d):
    """Eliminate d from values[s]; propagate when values or places <= 2.
    Return values, except return False if a contradiction is detected."""
    if d not in values[s]:
        return values ## Already eliminated
    values[s] = values[s].replace(d,'')
    ## (1) If a square s is reduced to one value d2, then eliminate d2 from the peers.
    if len(values[s]) == 0:
	return False ## Contradiction: removed last value
    elif len(values[s]) == 1:
        d2 = values[s]
        if not all(eliminate(values, s2, d2) for s2 in peers[s]):
            return False
    ## (2) If a unit u is reduced to only one place for a value d, then put it there.
    for u in units[s]:
	dplaces = [s for s in u if d in values[s]]
	if len(dplaces) == 0:
	    return False ## Contradiction: no place for this value
	elif len(dplaces) == 1:
	    # d can only be in one place in unit; assign it there
            if not assign(values, dplaces[0], d):
                return False
    return values
</pre>

<p>Now before we can go much further, we will need to 
display a puzzle:

<p>
<pre  class="prettyprint">
def display(values):
    "Display these values as a 2-D grid."
    width = 1+max(len(values[s]) for s in squares)
    line = '+'.join(['-'*(width*3)]*3)
    for r in rows:
        print ''.join(values[r+c].center(width)+('|' if c in '36' else '')
                      for c in cols)
        if r in 'CF': print line
    print
</pre>

<p>Now we're ready to go.  I picked the first example from a list of
<a href="easy50.txt">easy puzzles</a>
from the fine <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> 
<a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=96">Sudoku problem</a> and
tried it:
    
<p>
<pre  class="prettyprint">
>>> grid1 = '003020600900305001001806400008102900700000008006708200002609500800203009005010300'

>>> display(parse_grid(grid1))
4 8 3 |9 2 1 |6 5 7 
9 6 7 |3 4 5 |8 2 1 
2 5 1 |8 7 6 |4 9 3 
------+------+------
5 4 8 |1 3 2 |9 7 6 
7 2 9 |5 6 4 |1 3 8 
1 3 6 |7 9 8 |2 4 5 
------+------+------
3 7 2 |6 8 9 |5 1 4 
8 1 4 |2 5 3 |7 6 9 
6 9 5 |4 1 7 |3 8 2 
</pre>

<p>In this case, the puzzle was completely solved by rote application
of  strategies (1) and (2)! Unfortunately, that will not
always be the case.  Here is the first example from a list of <a
href="http://magictour.free.fr/top95">hard puzzles</a>:

<p>
<pre  class="prettyprint">
>>> grid2 = '4.....8.5.3..........7......2.....6.....8.4......1.......6.3.7.5..2.....1.4......'

>>> display(parse_grid(grid2))
   4      1679   12679  |  139     2369    269   |   8      1239     5    
 26789     3    1256789 | 14589   24569   245689 | 12679    1249   124679 
  2689   15689   125689 |   7     234569  245689 | 12369   12349   123469 
------------------------+------------------------+------------------------
  3789     2     15789  |  3459   34579    4579  | 13579     6     13789  
  3679   15679   15679  |  359      8     25679  |   4     12359   12379  
 36789     4     56789  |  359      1     25679  | 23579   23589   23789  
------------------------+------------------------+------------------------
  289      89     289   |   6      459      3    |  1259     7     12489  
   5      6789     3    |   2      479      1    |   69     489     4689  
   1      6789     4    |  589     579     5789  | 23569   23589   23689  
</pre>

<p>In this case, we are still a long way from solving the puzzle--61 squares remain uncertain.
What next?  We could try to code <a
href="http://www.sudokudragon.com/sudokustrategy.htm">more sophisticated 
strategies</a>.
For example, the <i>naked twins</i> strategy looks for two squares in
the same unit that both have the same two possible digits. Given
<tt>{'A5': '26', 'A6':'26', ...}</tt>, we
can conclude that 2 and 6 must be in <tt>A5</tt> and
<tt>A6</tt> (although we don't know which is where), and we can therefore
eliminate 2 and 6 from every other square in the <tt>A</tt> row unit.
We could code that strategy in a few lines by adding an <tt>elif
len(values[s]) == 2</tt> test to <tt>eliminate</tt>.
<p>
Coding up strategies like this is a possible route, but would require
hundreds of lines of code (there are dozens of these strategies), and we'd
never be sure if we could solve <i>every</i> puzzle.

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>The other route is to <i>search</i> for a solution: to
systematically try all possibilities until we hit one that works. The
code for this is less than a dozen lines, but we run another risk:
that it might take forever to run.  Consider that in the
<tt>grid2</tt> above, <tt>A2</tt> has 4 possibilities (<tt>1679</tt>)
and <tt>A3</tt> has 5 possibilities (<tt>12679</tt>); together that's
20, and if we keep <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=4*5*3*4*3*4*5*7*5*5*6*5*4*6*4*5*6*6*6*5*5*6*4*5*4*5*4*5*5*4*5*5*3*5*5*5*5*5*3*5*5*5*5*3*2*3*3*4*5*4*3*2*3*4*4*3*3*4*5*5*5">multiplying</a>,
we get 4.62838344192 &#215; 10<sup>38</sup> possibilities for the whole
puzzle.  How can we cope with that?  There are two choices.

<p> First, we could try a brute force approach.  Suppose we have a
very efficient program that takes only one instruction to evaluate a
position, and that we have access to the next-generation computing
technology, let's say a 10GHz processor with 1024 cores, and let's say
we could afford a million of them, and while we're shopping, let's say
we also pick up a time machine and go back 13 billion years to the
origin of the universe and start our program running.  We can then <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?&q=10+GHz+*+1024+*+1+million+*+13+billion+years+%2F+4.6e38+in+percent">compute</a>
that we'd be almost 1% done with this one puzzle by now.

<p>The second choice is to somehow process much more than one
possibility per machine instruction.  That seems impossible, but
fortunately it is exactly what constraint propagation does for us.
We don't have to try all 4 &times; 10<sup>38</sup> possibilities
because as soon as we try one we immediately eliminate many other
possibilities. For example, square H7 of this puzzle has two
possibilities, 6 and 9.  We can try 9 and quickly see that there is
a contradiction.  That means we've eliminated not just one possibility,
but fully <i>half</i> of the 4 &times; 10<sup>38</sup> choices.

<p> In fact, it turns out that to solve this particular puzzle we need
to look at only 25 possibilities and we only have to explicitly search
through 9 of the 61 unfilled squares; constraint propagation does the
rest.  For the list of 95 <a
href="http://magictour.free.fr/top95">hard puzzles</a>, on average we
need to consider 64 possibilities per puzzle, and in no case do we have
to search more than 16 squares.

<p>What is the search algorithm? Simple: first make sure we haven't
already found a solution or a contradiction, and if not, choose one
unfilled square and consider all its possible values.  One at a time,
try assigning the square each value, and searching from the resulting
position. In other words, we search for a value <tt>d</tt> such that
we can successfully search for a solution from the result of assigning
square <tt>s</tt> to <tt>d</tt>.  If the search leads to an failed
position, go back and consider another value of <tt>d</tt>. This is a
<i>recursive</i> search, and we call it a <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth-first</a></i> search
because we (recursively) consider all possibilities under
<tt>values[s] = d</tt> before we consider a different value for
<tt>s</tt>.

<p>To avoid bookkeeping complications, we create a new copy of
<tt>values</tt> for each recursive call to <tt>search</tt>. This way
each branch of the search tree is independent, and doesn't confuse
another branch.  (This is why I chose to implement the set of possible
values for a square as a string: I can copy <tt>values</tt> with
<tt>values.copy()</tt> which is simple and efficient.  If I
implemented a possibility as a Python <tt>set</tt> or <tt>list</tt> I
would need to use <tt>copy.deepcopy(values)</tt>, which is less
efficient.)  The alternative is to keep track of each change to
<tt>values</tt> and undo the change when we hit a dead end.  This is
known as <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking_search">backtracking search</a></i>. It makes sense when each step in
the search is a single change to a large data structure, but is
complicated when each assignment can lead to many other changes via
constraint propagation.

<p>There are two choices we have to make in implementing the search:
<i>variable ordering</i> (which square do we try first?) and <i>value
ordering</i> (which digit do we try first for the square?).  For
variable ordering, we will use a common heuristic called <i>minimum
remaining values</i>, which means that we choose the (or one of the)
square with the minimum number of possible values. Why?  Consider 
<tt>grid2</tt> above. Suppose we chose <tt>B3</tt> first.  It has 7
possibilities (<tt>1256789</tt>), so we'd expect to guess wrong with
probability 6/7.  If instead we chose <tt>G2</tt>, which only has 2
possibilities (<tt>89</tt>), we'd expect to be wrong with probability
only 1/2.  Thus we choose the square with the fewest possibilities and
the best chance of guessing right.  For value ordering we won't do
anything special; we'll consider the digits in numeric order.

<p>Now we're ready to define the <tt>solve</tt> function
in terms of the <tt>search</tt> function:

<p>
<pre  class="prettyprint">
def solve(grid): return search(parse_grid(grid))

def search(values):
    "Using depth-first search and propagation, try all possible values."
    if values is False:
        return False ## Failed earlier
    if all(len(values[s]) == 1 for s in squares): 
        return values ## Solved!
    ## Chose the unfilled square s with the fewest possibilities
    n,s = min((len(values[s]), s) for s in squares if len(values[s]) > 1)
    return some(search(assign(values.copy(), s, d)) 
		for d in values[s])

def some(seq):
    "Return some element of seq that is true."
    for e in seq:
        if e: return e
    return False
</pre>

<p>I guess if I want a really hard puzzle I'll have to make it myself. 
I don't know how to make hard puzzles, so I
generated a million random puzzles. My algorithm for making a random
puzzle is simple: first, randomly shuffle the order of the squares.  One by one,
fill in each square with a random digit, respecting the possible
digit choices.  If a contradiction is reached, start over. If we fill
at least 17 squares with at least 8 different digits 
then we are done. (Note: with less than 17
squares filled in or less than 8 different digits it is known that there will be
duplicate solutions. Thanks to Olivier Gr&eacute;goire for the fine suggestion about
8 different digits.) Even with these checks, 
my random puzzles are
not guaranteed to have one unique solution.  Many have multiple
solutions, and a few (about 0.2%) have no solution. Puzzles that appear in books and newspapers
always have one unique solution.

<p>The average time to solve a random puzzle is 0.01 seconds, and more
than 99.95% took less than 0.1 seconds, but a few took much longer:

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr><td align=left>0.032%<td align=right>(1 in 3,000)<td>took more than 0.1 seconds
<tr><td align=left>0.014%<td align=right>(1 in 7,000)<td>took more than 1 second
<tr><td align=left>0.003%<td align=right>(1 in 30,000)<td>took more than 10 seconds
<tr><td align=left>0.0001%<td align=right>(1 in 1,000,000)<td>took more than 100 seconds
</table>
</blockquote>

Here are the times in seconds for the 139 out of a million puzzles
that took more than a second, sorted, on linear and log scales:

<img src="sudo.gif" width=829 height=722>

<p>It is hard to draw conclusions from this.  Is the uptick in the last
few values significant?  If I generated 10 million puzzles, would one take 1000 seconds? 
Here's the hardest  (for my program) of the million random puzzles:

<p>Unfortunately, this is not a true Sudoku puzzle because it has multiple solutions. 
(It was generated before I incorporated Olivier Gr&eacute;goire's suggestion about checking
for 8 digits, so note that any solution to this puzzle leads to another solution where the 1s and 7s are swapped.) But is this an intrinsicly hard puzzle?  Or is the difficulty
an artifact of the particular variable- and value-ordering scheme
used by my <tt>search</tt> routine?  To test I randomized the
value ordering (I changed <tt>for d in values[s]</tt> in the last line
of <tt>search</tt> to be <tt>for d in shuffled(values[s])</tt> and
implemented <tt>shuffled</tt> using <tt>random.shuffle</tt>).  The
results were starkly bimodal: in 27 out of 30 trials the puzzle took
less than 0.02 seconds, while each of the other 3 trials took just about
190 seconds (about 10,000 times longer). There are multiple solutions to this puzzle, and the
randomized <tt>search</tt> found 13 different solutions.  My
guess is that somewhere early in the search there is a sequence of squares (probably
two) such that if we choose the exact wrong 
combination of values to fill the squares, it takes about 190 seconds to discover that there
is a contradiction.  But if we make any other choice, we very quickly
either find a solution or find a contradiction and move on to another choice.
So the speed of the algorithm is determined by whether it can avoid the deadly
combination of value choices.  

<P>Randomization works most of the time (27 out of 30), but perhaps we could
do even better by considering a better value ordering (one popular
heuristic is <i>least-constraining value</i>, which chooses first the
value that imposes the fewest constraints on peers), or by trying a
smarter variable ordering.  

<p>More experimentation would be needed before I could give a good
characterization of the hard puzzles.  I decided to experiment on
another million random puzzles, this time keeping statistics on the
mean, 50th (median), 90th and 99th percentiles, maximum and standard
deviation of run times.  The results were similar, except this time I got two puzzles that took over 100 seconds, and one took quite a bit longer: 1439 seconds.
It turns out this puzzle is one of the 0.2% that has no
solution, so maybe it doesn't count.  But the main message is that the
mean and median stay about the same even as we sample more, but the
maximum keeps going up--dramatically.  The standard deviation
edges up too, but mostly because of the very few very long times that
are way out beyond the 99th percentile.  This is a
<i>heavy-tailed</i> distribution, not a normal one. 

<p>For comparison, the tables below give the statistics for puzzle-solving run times on the left, and for samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean 0.014 and standard deviation 1.4794 on the right. Note that with a million samples, the max of the Gaussian is 5 standard deviations above the mean (roughly what you'd expect from a Gaussian), while the maximum puzzle run time is 1000 standard deviations above the mean.

<h2>Why?</h2>

Why did I do this? As computer security expert <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Laurie">Ben Laurie</a> has
stated, Sudoku is "a denial of service attack on human intellect". 
Several people I know (including my
wife) were infected by the virus, and I thought maybe this would
demonstrate that they didn't need to spend any more time on Sudoku.  It
didn't work for my friends (although my wife has since independently
kicked the habit without my help), but at least one stranger wrote
and said this page worked for him, so I've made the world more
productive. And perhaps along the way I've taught something about
Python, constraint propagation, and search.
